# Compatibility Testing
    Here I manually tested all functionality and features across all responsive sizes and browsers. For this, I used Chrome, Opera, Firefox and Edge.

    -[Chrome](documentation/CHROME.md)
    -[Opera](documentation/OPERA.md)
    -[Firefox](documentation/FIREFOX.md)
    -[Edge](documentation/EDGE.md)
    
    Site Speed Tests
    For this, I used [Catchpoint's Site Performance Service.](https://www.webpagetest.org/) This allows you to test site performance, speed, core web vitals and visual comparisons on all devices. 

    For device compatibilty I tested the following devices:
        -Two desktop computers using Firefox and Chrome respectively
        -A Samsung Galaxy S20 FE
        -ASUS Notebook PC using Chrome
        -Samsung A12
        -Samsung M12
        -Samsung A03
    All of these devices had no issues running the site or interacting with features.
    
# User Experience Testing
    -I asked some family and friends to load the website on their devices and to test anything that seemed like it was interactable. The feedback was unanimous in that there were no issues.
    -The design was clear and easy to understand, they had no issue navigating the site or information presented. 
    -They offered some suggestions for design and content that I hope to implement in the future, such as creating a dedicated thumbnail for the showcase video.
