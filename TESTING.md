# Testing

Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

## Code Validation
All files were put through the appropriate validators and came back with no errors. 

### HTML
For all HTML files, I used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator.](https://validator.w3.org)

**Home Page**

**About Page**

**Guide Page #1**
For the guide page, a lot of errors were thrown however none of these are actually an issue or relevant. The sections do not have headers on purpose and the classes being duplicated was due to the necessity to maintain a style throughout the guide. These do not cause any issues with the site functionality or user experience. All other guide pages are identical to this one structure and code wise, only differing in content.

### Site Speed Tests
For this, I used [Catchpoint's Site Performance Service.](https://www.webpagetest.org/) This allows you to test site performance, speed, core web vitals and visual comparisons on all devices.

For device compatibilty I tested the following devices:
- Two desktop computers using Firefox and Chrome respectively

- ASUS Notebook PC using Chrome 

- Samsung Galaxy S20 FE

- Samsung Galaxy A12

- Samsung Galaxy M12

- Samsung Galaxy A03

All of these devices had no issues running the site or interacting with features.
    
### User Experience Testing

- I asked some family and friends to load the website on their devices and to test anything that seemed like it was interactable. The feedback was unanimous in that there were no issues.
- The design was clear and easy to understand, they had no issue navigating the site or information presented. 
- They offered some suggestions for design and content that I hope to implement in the future, such as creating a dedicated thumbnail for the showcase video.

### User Feedback Incorporation:
Some suggestions for features I have taken on board include 
- The icon for the return to top button being a Minecraft pickaxe
- The showcase video should have a thumbnail

### Bugs
There are no remaining bugs that I'm aware of
