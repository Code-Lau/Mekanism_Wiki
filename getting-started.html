                <p>

                    Mekanism adds a few ores to the mix, but the most important one is Osmium ore.

                    Though brittle in real life, this is the key metal in Mekanism crafting alongside Iron.

                    It is recommended to collect a lot of it throughout your trip to the mines.

                    Once you’re set up and ready to start, the first step is to get some basic machines up and running.

                    These machines will enable you to make key crafting components for the rest of the

                    modded links and machinery.

                <p>

                    Assuming you don’t have any other mods installed, the first thing we’re going to make is the

                    Heat Generator. If this isn’t showing up in your Creative Menu or JEI, perhaps you missed the add-on

                    mod,

                    </a>

                    If you do have other mods installed or are using a modpack, the power systems are generally
                    interchangeable.

                    You can plug in your machines to a pre-existing power source or make beginner generators from other

                    mods to substitute Mekanism’s.

                    The Heat Generator takes a fuel input, this can be any basic minecraft fuel type as well as Mekanism’s own fuel

                    types and converts it into Forge Energy (FE). FE is an energy type used by a lot of different mods,

                    so Mekanism adopted it for convenience.

                    Redstone Flux (RF), Joules (J) and Energy Units (EU) are other types used by some popular mods.

                    a way to make our fuel more efficient. The second most important use of the Metallurgic Infuser

                    is to make alloys and circuits. The first tier of alloy is the Infused Alloy, which is red and

                    made by combining 10mb of Redstone and an iron ingot. To make the first tier of circuit, the

                    Basic Control Circuit, which is green, you combine 10mb of Redstone and an osmium ingot. These

                    and the later tiers will be used in a lot of crafting.

                    With steel ingots and basic control circuits, we can make our second machine, the Enrichment

                    Chamber. This involves a steel frame. Steel frames are used for most machinery frames, made using 4

                    steel

                <p>
                     The enrichment chamber has two very important roles. The first is turning items into 
                     their enriched counterparts for better fuel efficiency. The second is the ability to 
                     multiply ores. By placing 3 of any raw ore in, you will get 4 dusts, which can be smelted 
                     into 4 ingots. We will talk more about this in the next section, but for now it's important to 
                     mention.

                    into enriched coal. Enriched coal is worth much more at 80mb, as opposed to coal’s measly 10mb.

                    This is a much more efficient use of fuel, and all enriched versions can be put into the

                    Metallurgic Infuser fuel slot just like their normal counterparts.</p>

                    Now that we have our fuel efficiency sorted out, we can look into a more efficient power source.

                    We have a few options: The solar panel, the wind generator, the gas burning generator, the bio

                    generator, the fission reactor and turbine combo and the fusion reactor. The gas-burning generator

                    and reactors are mid to late game power sources respectively, so for now we just want something

                    that’s cheap and renewable.

                <h2>ENERGY PER TICK</h2>
                <p>
                    When it comes to generators, unlike the Heat Generator which makes a

                    set amount of energy per burn time, these generators all run on the concept of
                    “Energy per tick”.
                    This refers to the base game’s program loop, which runs at a fixed rate of 20 ticks per second.

                    This means that one tick occurs every 0.05s. These generators will be outputting their set FE amount

                    based on their criteria per tick. Meaning that whatever the machine says it’s outputting “FE/t”,

                    that happens 20 times in a second. If the generator is outputting 9.6FE/t, that means every second

                    it’s producing 192FE. To start with, a few of the options and energy related blocks use an energy

                    tablet as a crafting option. This is 3 gold ingots, 2 infused alloys and 4 redstone.

                    106.89FE/t.

                    This doesn’t have the previous limitations of nature in the physical sense, it requires biofuel.

                    Biofuel

                    is made

                    using a crusher, by inputting any organic matter. It is possible to create automatic farms that feed

                    crusher, which then feeds the biofuel into the bio generator. It outputs 500FE at a rate of 1FE/t.
