                <h2>How to install a mod</h2>
                <p>
                    If you’re new to modding Minecraft, we can guide you on how to install and play Mekanism. Whether you want to play a mod individually or an entire modpack, you'll
                    want to use either a launcher or a loader.

                <h2>Launchers</h2>
                <p> Players tend to use one of a couple different, popular launchers to 
                    play their mods. Launchers are applications that host mods and offer the ability to expressly install the files to the right locations for you. This is perfect 
                    for most players, new and old. Some relevant ones are <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/download/?from=button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prism Launcher,</a> 
                    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/download/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curseforge,</a> <a href="https://www.feed-the-beast.com/ftb-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FeedTheBeast,</a> 
                    <a href="https://multimc.org/#Download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MultiMC</a> or the <a href="https://atlauncher.com/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ATLauncher.</a> These are launchers 
                    that allow you to download individual mods or entire modpacks within them. Then, they open the Minecraft launcher with the mod(s) loaded as an instance you can 
                    save and customise.

                <h2>Installing through a launcher</h2>
                <p>If you’re using a launcher, navigate to the search bar and search up the mod/modpack you’re looking for. Make sure to check the version differences for both the 
                    mod/modpack and Minecraft. For example, you might want to play the newest version of Minecraft, which is 1.21.1. Minecraft always formats its updates in 4 numbers 
                    separated by periods. A mod author may list their updates differently, and you might have to check changelogs to see what versions are best for you. If you’re 
                    downloading a mod/modpack to join a server, you need to make sure that both the minecraft version and the mod/modpack version are correct and match the server’s. 
                    If you’re using a launcher, you may be given an option in the settings to allocate memory (GB of RAM) to Minecraft. It’s recommended to set this to whatever your 
                    PC needs as sometimes mods can be incredibly demanding on your CPU (The Processor). If you’re unsure about what to set it to, try looking up recommendations 
                    followed by the mod or modpack you’re planning to use or by your PC specifications. If you only have limited memory, you don’t want to allocate too much of it.

                <h2>Loaders</h2>
                <p>If you only want to play Mekanism, there are two ways to go about it. You can do as mentioned above, search for it, download it and run it through the launcher. 
                    There is an alternative if you’re not interested in using launchers (though we’d recommend it if you’re unsure). You can install mods without a launcher, but 
                    you’ll need what’s called a loader. Two very common and popular loaders are Forge and Fabric. A loader is a tool that makes 
                    the mod function, some mods can run on their own, but a lot will need a loader. What one you choose entirely depends on the kind of mod you want to run. Both 
                    Forge and Fabric run most mods well, and you’ll know which one you should pick based on the mod itself. Mods should list what loader they are compatible with. 
                    Forge and Curseforge are not the same thing, Forge is a loader, Curseforge is a mod/modpack hosting service. Any mod hosted by Curseforge does not automatically 
                    make Forge compatible.

                <h2>Installing through a loader</h2>
                <p>Download the mods you want to use, which will be in the form of a Java file. Make sure you have Java installed and up to date. Open windows explorer (Windows Key + S) 
                    and type in, “%appdata\.minecraft” into the search bar. If you don’t already have one, create a folder for your mods. Move the executable jar files you downloaded into 
                    the mods folder. Then, install either Forge or Fabric, and let it create a new instance for you. Now you can select the instance it created and click play. If you follow 
                    these steps exactly and still encounter issues, keep in mind they could be issues to do with the mod itself, your allocated memory or your pc itself.
