                <h2>ORE PROCESSING</h2>
                <p> 
                    One of the main draws to Mekanism is its unique and scientific based approach to ore multiplying.
                    In the base game, we have the fortune enchantment. With no enchantment on a pickaxe, you would get
                    just 1 diamond from a diamond ore block. With fortune 3, that jumps up to an average of 2, with the
                    maximum of 4. However it’s not guaranteed to get 4 or even 2 every time. With ore processing, not
                    only are the conversion rates the same every time, but at the maximum tier, 3 raw ores will give
                    you 10 ingots.

                    tier by tier. We've already been introduced to the universal cable, which transfers energy, but there 
                    are 4 more types of cables in Mekanism. The logistical transporter, the thermodynamic conductor, the 
                    mechanical pipe and the pressurised tube. Like the universal cable, all of these cables have have four 
                    tiers, each holding more of and transferring their respective contents faster with each tier.

                    dedicated storage systems or outputs from machines and sent to wherever you want. This is a great way to

                    warmer biomes speed up the process while colder biomes slow it down. This shouldn't be too great of a 
                    concern, but if it is, you can always make more heat sources.

                    The configurator is a handy tool that acts as Mekanism's wrench. It can do a variety of things such 
                    as changing the input/output state of a machine by looking at it, rather than going into the UI. 
                    Changing the mode of a cable's transport, by shift right clicking a cable you can change it to: push, 
                    pull, none or back to normal. You can tell cables to be activated on redstone, empty machines or 
                    rotate them.

                <h2>TIER ONE</h2>
                <p> Tier one only involves a machine we already have: the enrichment chamber. As we know, we can place some 
                    materials in and get their enriched versions, but we can also place raw ore inside. Inserting 3 raw ore 
                    will give you four of its corresponding dusts. Those dusts can then be smelted into ingots, and thus, you 
                    have an extra ore. If you’re not interested in making many machines and processes in the chart above, 
                    you can stop here. Having an extra ore is already pretty good, but we can make that 5x. Its worth noting
                    that whatever stage of the process you're at, remember to set your machines to auto eject items so they
                    can work away without needing you. You can place the enrichment chamber right next to your energized smelter
                    or furnace to speed up the process.

                    input of fluid and outputs two gases. To make oxygen, we want to input water, which will separate it 
                    into hydrogen and oxygen. If the internal storage for the gases are filled up, the machine will stop 
                    working. We will be using the oxygen, but what about the hydrogen? Hydrogen will be useful to use later, 
                    but if you want, you can simply hit “DUMP” or “DUMP EXCESS”. This will empty the tank constantly allowing 
                    the machine to continue working. If you want to store it for later, we can make a chemical tank.

                    emptied with pressurised tubes. So for now, you could place pressurised tubes between a tank and the

                    variety of ways in modpacks, but in this we'll simply cover the electric pump. The electric pump is a 
                    powered single block device that will pump any fluid underneath it (or around it). Place the pump above 
                    a water source block, and input a power cable on the side that has the green square. The fluids will be 
                    pumped out through a mechanical pipe placed on top. We then want to connect the mechanical pipe to the 
                    electrolytic separator.

                    hydrogen and oxygen. These are gases, so we use the pressurised tube. In the input and output UI, when a machine 
                    has two possible outputs, they will be 
                    labelled 1 and 2. Whatever is on the left will be output 1 and output 2 is whatever is on the right. If 
                    you have a chemical tank for hydrogen storage hooked up, you would want to select the pressurised tube 
                    connected to the tank and click it until it says, “Output 1”. For the pressurised tube going to the purification 
                    chamber, you want to click on that until it says, “Output 2”.

                    evaporation controller and a minimum of two thermal evaporation valves. The structure can be as tall as 18 blocks, 
                    and the higher you build it, the more mb per tick it will produce. Being a multi block structure, the TEP will emit 
                    redstone particles to indicate it has been built in a functional capacity.

                <p>Constructing the TEP will likely take up the bulk of your time in this tier. 4 thermal evaporation blocks take 4 
                    steel and 1 copper. The controller takes 5 blocks, glass and 2 advanced circuits. A valve takes 4 blocks and an 
                    advanced processor. So the materials are as follows:

                    4x3: 37 blocks 1 controller 2 valves 
                    62 blocks total = 248 steel 62 copper
                    3 advanced processors and 1 glass pane
